______________________**MACHINE LEARNING PROCESS**

1-Define the objective of the problem (to predict the possibility of rain by studying the weather conditions)
	-what are we trying to predict?
	-what are the target features?
	-what is the input data?
	-is the kind of problem binary classification? regression? clustering?

2-Data gathering (weather conditions, humidity level, temprature, pressure, scraped from web or manually collected)

3-Preparing data (getting rid of missing values and incosistencies)

4-Exploratory data analysis (understanding the patterns and trends in the data,find correlations between variables)

5-Building a machine learning model (a predictive model is built using ml algotithms)

6-Model evaluation and optimization
	-ml model is evaluated using testing data
	-accuracy of model is calculated
	-imporovement in the model is done (paramater tuning)

7-Predictions 


______________________**TYPES OF MACHINE LEARNING**

1-Supervised learning
	-teaching and training the machine using well labelled data
	-solves regression and classification problems
	-popular algorithms used (linear regression, logistic regression, KNN, support vector machine)

2-Unsupervised learning
	-training the machine using information that is unlabeled and allowing the algorithm to act on that information without guidance
	-solves association and clustering problems
	-popular algorithms used (k-means, c-means)

3-Reinforcement learning
	-an agent is put in an enviroment and he learns to behave in it by performing certain actions and observing the rewards which it gets from those actions.
	-solves reward based problems
	-popular algorithms used (Q-learning, SARSA)

______________________**TYPES OF PROBLEMS THAT ARE SOLVED BY MACHINE LEARNING**

1-Regression
	-supervised learning
	-output is a continuous quantity
	-main aim is to forecast or predict
	-algorithm: linear regression
	-ex: stock market prediction

2-Classification
	-supervised learning
	-output is a categorical quantity
	-main aim is to compute the category of the data
	-algorithm: logistic regression
	-ex: classify emails as spam or non spam

3-Clustering
	-unsupervised learning
	-assigns data points into clusters
	-main aim is to group similar items clusters
	-algorithm: k-means
	-ex: find all fraudulent transactions - netflix

______________________**SUPERVISED LEARNING ALGORITHMS**

1- Linear regression
	-Y(dependent variable) = Bo(y intercept) + B1(slope)X(independant variable) + e(error)

2- Logistic regression
	-predicts a dependent categorical variables using a given set of independent variables 

3- Decision tree
	-uses ID3 algorithm
	-calculate entropy and information gain to find the best attribute

4- Random forest
	-bootsrapping > decision trees
	-Avoids overfitting
	-more accurate than decision tree
	-uses bagging
